    안녕하세요! Java, Spring Framework, Spring Boot를 주로 사용하는 웹/앱 서비스 백엔드 개발자 김재령입니다.

다양한 프로젝트를 진행하며 객체지향적인 설계와 유지보수성을 고려하여 개발을 하기위해 노력하고 있습니다.
각 프로젝트에 항상 새로운 기술을 학습하고 적용하는 것을 즐기며, 문제 해결을 위한 끊임없는 도전을 이어가고 있으며,
사용자의 입장에서 생각하며 클라이언트 친화적인 개발을 진행하고자 노력하고 있습니다.

또한 백엔드 개발 뿐만 아니라 React를 활용한 프론트엔드 경험도 보유하고 있기에 다른 팀과도 원활한 협업이 가능할것이라고 생각합니다.

매일의 노력이 큰 변화를 만든다고 생각합니다. 
다소 느리더라도 꾸준히 성장하는 그런 개발자가 되겠습니다.
감사합니다

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
